# InsecureRestAPI

_InsecureRestAPI_ is a simple NodeJS/Express/MongoFB REST API that can be used for the demonstration of Application Security testing tools - such as [OpenText Application Security](https://www.opentext.com/products/application-security).

Pre-requisities
---------------

 - [Node.js 20 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
 - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Community Edition (optional as an embedded version will be downloaded for testing)
 - Docker installation (optional)

Run Application (locally)
-------------------------

You can the run the application locally using the following:


```
npm install
npm install -g ts-node-dev
npm run dev
```

The API should then be available at the URL `http://localhost:5000`. If it fails to start,
make sure you have no other applications running on port 5000. 

Run Application (as Docker container)
-------------------------------------

You also can build a Docker image for the application using the following:

```
npm run build
docker build -t demoapi:latest .
```

Then run the container using a command similar to the following:

```
docker run -dp 8080:5000 demoapi:latest
```

The API should then be available at the URL `http://localhost:8080`. If it fails to start,
make sure you have no other applications running on port 8080.

Using the API
-------------

You can use the Swagger Documentation to test the API endpoints.
First login as a user using the endpoint "/api/v1/site/sign-in" and either of the following credentials

    - email: user1@localhost.com
      password: password
    - email: admin@localhost.com
      password: password

Then copy the value of the `accessToken` returned. Go back to the top of the page. Click on **Authorize**
and enter this value.

There are also some example [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) collections in the `etc` directory.

Scan Application (with OpenText Application Security)
-----------------------------------------------------

To carry out a Fortify Static Code Analyzer local scan, run the following:

```
make sast-scan
```

To carry out a Fortify ScanCentral SAST scan, run the following:

```
fcli ssc session login
scancentral package -o package.zip -bt none
fcli sast-scan start --release "_YOURAPP_:_YOURREL_" -f package.zip --store curScan
fcli sast-scan wait-for ::curScan::
fcli ssc action run appversion-summary --av "_YOURAPP_:_YOURREL_" -fs "Security Auditor View" -f summary.md
```

To carry out a Fortify on Demand scan, run the following:

```
fcli fod session login
scancentral package -o package.zip -bt none -oss
fcli fod sast-scan start --release "_YOURAPP_:_YOURREL_" -f package.zip --store curScan
fcli fod sast-scan wait-for ::curScan::
fcli fod action run release-summary --rel "_YOURAPP_:_YOURREL_" -f summary.md
```
